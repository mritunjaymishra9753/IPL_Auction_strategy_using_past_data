Developing auction strategy for new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong
and balanced squad

# Description
This repository showcases my project on developing an auction strategy for a new IPL franchise, utilizing SQL and Excel as primary tools for data analysis.

By leveraging SQL queries, I extracted and manipulated relevant data from the IPL dataset. This allowed me to explore player performances, team dynamics, and auction trends to identify key insights for building a competitive and balanced squad.

In Excel, I further analyzed the extracted data, employing various formulas, functions, and visualizations to uncover patterns and make data-driven decisions. I focused on identifying influential factors such as player attributes, team strategies, and past performance indicators.

The repository includes SQL scripts demonstrating data extraction and manipulation techniques, as well as Excel spreadsheets showcasing data analysis, formulas, and visualizations. By sharing these resources, I aim to provide practical guidance to others interested in utilizing SQL and Excel for IPL auction strategy analysis.

Through this project, I have demonstrated the effectiveness of SQL and Excel in analyzing IPL data, enabling the development of a strong auction strategy for new franchises.
